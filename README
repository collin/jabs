Javascript Abstract Behavior Syntax? What's that?

I was working on a project *very* similar to http://github.com/nex3/jabl in the months running up to RubyFringe.

Then I saw Hampton's presenation. Oops.

Well I had all this work and I wanted to see what it'd take to get it producing usable javascript.

I pulled it out of http://github.com/collin/lucky7 and stuck it here.

And hacked around a bit, removing some features, adding others.

Check it out:

(add github to rubygems)
gem install collin-fold
git://github.com/collin/jabs.git
cd jabs

Look through /examples
